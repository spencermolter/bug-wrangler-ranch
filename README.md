# Welcome to Bug Wrangler Ranch

This first self-assessment is for you to hone several Core Skills that you need as a software developer.

Taking your time now to be thorough, reflective, patient and curious will give you the foundation to be successful throughout the rest of this course and your career.

If you rush this, or think of it as a test to be "passed", then you will already be on the wrong path.

> ðŸ§¨ Make sure you answer the vocabulary and understanding questions at the end of this document before notifying your coaches that you are done with the project

## Description

Slim Jenkins offers a vacation package for people who have always wanted to join a cattle driving team across the American Midwest.

He calls it the **Kansas Slim's Cattle Adventure**.

People join a team of experienced drovers who will train them in the basics of herding cattle and driving them across hundreds of miles to their destination at Old Red's Ranch.

Unfortunately, someone gained access to the code that produces an outline of the adventure to the paying customers, so Slim has hired you to examine and fix the code.

## Learning Objectives

Here are your learning objectives for this self-assessment.

1. Able to use the debugger to step through existing code to discover root causes of bugs.
2. Drawing a sequence diagram for a project.
   > Use the [sequencediagram.org](https://sequencediagram.org/) site to generate your sequence diagram. Make sure you save your work as you go.
3. Demonstrate learning efficiency by researching concepts you haven't seen before using your peers, mentors, and the World Wide Web as resources.
4. Awareness of when you need help, and then seeking it out.

## Starter Code

Slim Jenkins has the existing code on Github, so you need to download it from there. Actually, developers call this process _cloning a repository_.

In your terminal, to go your workspace directory.

```sh
cd ~/workspace
```

Then clone the repository to your machine with the following command.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/Nashville-Software-School-Assessments/bug-wrangler-ranch.git
```

This will create a new sub-directory called `bug-wrangler-ranch`. Use the `cd` command to navigate into that directory and open it in VS Code.

```sh
cd bug-wrangler-ranch
code .
```

Open the `main.js` and create your `launch.json` so that you can debug the code starting with `main.js`. Then run the program and start the investigation.

## Example Output

If you are able to fix all of the bugs, you will output similar to what is below.

```sh
************************************************

                               ||w--||     \|/

You will be accompanying 5 drovers as they drive 50 cattle to Old Red's Ranch for grazing

The herd is made of up the following types of cattle:
Ankole-Watusi,Brown Swiss,Brown Swiss,American Angus,Brown Swiss,
Ankina,American Angus,Ankina,Brown Swiss,Ankole-Watusi,Brown Swiss,
Brown Swiss,American Angus,Ankina,Ankole-Watusi,Brown Swiss,Brown Swiss,
Ankina,Brown Swiss,Ankina,Ankole-Watusi,Brown Swiss,Brown Swiss,
Ankole-Watusi,American Angus,Brown Swiss,American Angus,Ankole-Watusi,

Here is the team of drovers you will be joining
        * Melvyn Hethron
        * Yancy Gresley
        * Willabella Attarge
        * Ynes Gyenes
        * Farlie Spere


Your journey will take you through the wildness of the American Midwest and across the following terrain
        * forest
        * plain
        * river
        * mountain
```

## Vocabulary and Understanding

> ðŸ§¨ Before you click the "Assessment Complete" button on the Learning Platform, add your answers below for each question and make a commit. It is your option to request a face-to-face meeting with a coach for a vocabulary review.

1. In the **main** module, one of the first lines of code is `const drovers = hireDrovers(cattleToDrive)`. Explain what the value of the `drovers` variable is when that line of code runs.
   > The "drovers" variable contains both the requested length, 5, and holds the objects of the 5 random drovers within the empty "drovers" array in drovers.js. The drovers array now contains five objects each with: first_name, gender, id, and last_name.
2. At the bottom of the main module, you will see the following code - `for (const drover of drovers)`. Explain what the values of both the `drover` and the `drovers` variables are.
   > In the For loop during runtime, "drover" is a placeholder variable, holding individual objects from the "drovers" array. When the For loop fetches a drover object from the "drovers" array, it is subsequently called by the console log line to be printed. Once printed, the "drover" variable fetches a new drover object from the "drovers" array. TL;DR - The "drover" variable holds individual objects from the "drovers" array until the array terminates and is out of objects, then "drover" becomes undefined.
3. In the **journey** module, there is a `journeyMaker()` function. In that function, there is a variable named `areas` which will have the value of an object. Use your debugger to show what the value of each key is on that object. Use [Loom](https://www.loom.com) to record your session.
   > (https://www.loom.com/share/c87c6f3722b5405da8184989af5a04b9?sid=e779fed2-2a33-4859-a30e-fe0612cdd4d3)
4. Also in the **journey** module, there is the following code:
   ```js
   for (let forestNumber = 0; forestNumber < areas.forests; forestNumber++) {
      journey.push("forest")
   }
   ```
   Explain this code with your best vocabulary.
   > The first part "let forestNumber = 0" initializes the iteration counter for the loop. Next line "forestNumber < areas.forests" is a boolean which keeps the For loop running until the value of forestNumber is greater than areas.forests. "areas.forests" is a random value between 1-2.  The line "forestNumber++" simply increases the iteration counter by 1 for that execution. Last line "journey.push("forest")" appends the value(s) to become an element of "journey". 
5. Explain the value of the `database` variable in the **database** module. Be as comprehensive as possible.
   > "Database.js" is an object, which holds two important arrays, "cattleTypes" and "drovers". The "cattleTypes" contains an array of objects, and within those objects are two keys, "id" and "breed", which correspond to set values. Drovers is yet another array of objects, this time containing many more objects with four key-value pairs; "id", "first_name", "last_name", and "gender". Again, each containing set corresponding values. These values are important because we use them frequently in multiple modules to streamline and make our code prettier.
6. In the **drovers** module, there is a `hireDrovers()` function. You will notice the following code on that line - `(herdSize)`. What is that defining, and where does it get its value?
   > So, herdSize is a parameter for the "hireDrovers" function. However, it is also a placeholder for another value found in "main.js". When "main.js" is ran, the value 50 is assigned to "herdSize", and then used in the function in "drovers.js" for the required value. I changed the name for the variable to herdSize just for simplicity, but you can keep the original name and it would run just the same. Since the placeholder is receiving its value from a set value in "main.js", the name means very little, so long as it is called properly in the function.


## Final Step

Now you need to upload your code to Github so a coach can review it and the answers to your vocabulary and understanding questions. Watch the <a href="https://app.screencastify.com/v3/watch/AwPn0FXfji60TxHuUVkU" target="_blank">Sharing assessment repository<a> video for instructions on how to do it.
